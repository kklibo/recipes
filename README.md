## Pemmican
A simplified modern version of the historical cold-weather survival food.

* very long room temperature shelf life
* air-free & water-free: maximize nutrition, waste no volume or mass
* still soft enough to chew if eaten when frozen
* carb-free
* plant-free

### Ingredients:
* 3 parts powdered dehydrated 96%/4% beef
* 2 parts beef tallow

Ratios are by mass. The yield from 100g total mass is the size of a large candy bar.

### Equipment:
* food scale (recommended)
* non-stick pan
* mold (tupperware, silicone candy bar mold, etc)
* mixing bowl + spoon or other stirring implement

### Procedure
1. On low heat, melt the tallow in the non-stick pan.
2. Put the powdered beef in the mixing bowl.
3. When the tallow is fully liquified and clear, pour it into the beef powder and mix it until no dry beef powder remains.
4. Pour the mixture into the mold.
5. Let it cool and solidify, or freeze it (frozen bars may maintain their shape better during vacuum sealing).
 

### Nutrition
100g pemmican bar: 660 kcals, 50g protein

### Notes
 - The 3:2 ratio was chosen to homogenize the mixture based on the granularity of powdered beef I tend to make: adding more than 40% tallow may result in a top layer of pure tallow after the pemmican mixture cools and solidifies. Generally, powdering the beef to finer granularity should increase the amount of tallow it will homogenize with.
 - This procedure can be pretty inefficient the first few times, and working with tallow can be messy (after all, it is pure solid fat). In practice, I tend to use two approaches:
    1. I mix 600g of pemmican mixture in a mixing bowl, then use a multi-bar silicone mold and make batches of 10x ~60g bars. These are roughly candy bar sized, have ~380kcals, and are suitable for giving to people to try or for vacuum sealing with many in one bag.
    2. I use rectangular ziploc food containers as molds and mix the beef and tallow right in them, making 200g super-bars. These bars have 1320kcals and 101g protein: two of them make a very efficient full-day ration.
- This recipe intentionally does not add salt. I find that pouring salt (or other seasonings) on the pemmican as I eat it tastes better than mixing it in, and allows the individual consumer of the pemmican to decide how much sodium they want. If desired, salt could be added to this recipe.


## Long-term storage
For pemmican and pseudopemmican, I use a FoodSaver vacuum sealer. After vacuum sealing, I store them at room temperature and I've never noticed any variation in taste or quality over many months of storage. I've never seen them go bad, so I'm not sure what the shelf life is, but it's probably measured in years.
